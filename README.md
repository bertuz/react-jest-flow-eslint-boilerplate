# React Jest Flow ESLint Boilerplate 

This is my very personal boilerplate to start developing React applications along with `Flow`,
`ESLint` and `Jest` as my testing framework.

I just needed it with my own personal tweaks and tools, so I made it myself :). But feel free to fork if you need it :-)
